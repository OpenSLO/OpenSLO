# Glossary

SLO community created over the time specific terminology, not every user coming to projects like OpenSLO knows exactly what
everything means. This glossary should help newcomers to understand things we discuss here and maybe share materials to
learn more. Another thing is that we need a place where we can write down definitions to have easier discussions about
subjects that can be understood differently.


## Definitions

Service Level Indicator(SLI) – a carefully defined quantitative measure of some aspect of the level of service that is provided.

Service Level Objective(SLO) – a target value or range of values for a service level that is measured by an SLI.

Service Level Agreements(SLA) – an explicit or implicit contract with your users that includes consequences of
meeting (or missing) the SLOs they contain.

Time window – time in which reliability of service is measured and calculated.

Error budget – a measurement that allows us to see how much SLO can be violated in a given period of time.

## Literature
Books that are great to learn about SLO concept:
 - [Google's SRE book](https://sre.google/sre-book/table-of-contents/)
 - [Implementing Service Level Objectives](https://www.oreilly.com/library/view/implementing-service-level/9781492076803/)
