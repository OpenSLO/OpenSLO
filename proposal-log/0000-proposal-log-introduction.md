# Proposal Log Introduction

**Issue**: [Create Proposal Directory](https://github.com/OpenSLO/OpenSLO/issues/250)

To provide better clarity and context for the specification, we aim to create a proposal log. This log will document changes based on community proposals, allowing readers to understand why specific decisions were made.

## Description

The proposal log is inspired by the Architecture Decision Log (ADR), a well-known engineering practice, but tailored to suit specification development. Unlike software architectures, specifications lack traditional architecture, so the process has been adapted accordingly.

Whenever significant discussions occur with multiple potential solutions, a new proposal log should be created to document the final decision. This ensures that:
1. Everyone involved understands the final resolution in the same way.
2. New contributors can refer to these logs to understand the reasoning behind specific choices and avoid revisiting resolved issues.

This approach enhances transparency and provides a reliable reference for the evolution of the specification.

## Consequences

The introduction of a proposal log adds a new process, which may not be consistently utilized by maintainers.

## Alternatives

1. **Rely solely on GitHub Issues:**
   - GitHub Issues remain the main platform for discussions.
   - However, the proposal log would act as a summarized record and final decision for intense or high-impact discussions.

2. **Do nothing:**
   - Without a proposal log, thereâ€™s a greater risk of miscommunication or rehashing previously resolved discussions.
   - The log helps ensure all participants have a shared understanding of decisions and reduces the chance of contradicting previously agreed-upon outcomes.
