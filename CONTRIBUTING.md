Please make a fork of the repo, and summit a PR from there. More information can
be found [here](https://docs.github.com/en/github/collaborating-with-issues-and-pull-requests/creating-a-pull-request).

This project utilizes [devbox](https://github.com/jetify-com/devbox) in order
to provide a consistent and reliable development environment.
You can however install the required dependencies manually.

All the development commands are provided via `Makefile`.
You can run `make help` to see the list of available commands.

Checks which are run as part of the CI pipeline can be run locally wth:

```sh
make check
```

If you see formatting or code generation errors you can fix them with:

```sh
make format && make generate
```

If you have devbox installed, you can initialize the environment with:

```sh
make activate
```

Furthermore, you can utilize devbox's direnv integration to automatically
activate the environment when you enter the project directory, to do so run:

```sh

```
